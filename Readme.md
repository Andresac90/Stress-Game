1. # <a name="_toc199316705"></a>Game Concept
Stress is a 2D action platformer, where you take control of a nameless character that can perform two different actions with each hand. Using a grappling hook and attacking with a sword.
1. # <a name="_toc199316706"></a>Main Mechanics
The game will consist of a fixed number of levels, to show the main mechanics of the game. 

The player has these main actions:
1. ## <a name="_toc199316707"></a>Walk
The player can walk in two directions, left and right. He cannot sprint but his normal velocity is high.
1. ## <a name="_toc199316708"></a>Jump
The player can jump only once and can control the character direction mid-air.
1. ## <a name="_toc199316709"></a>Grappling Hook
The player can use a grappling hook that is attached to the character’s left hand. This hook can be used as a rope and to reach other parts of the level. It can also grab enemies and bring them to the player.
1. ## <a name="_toc199316710"></a>Sword
There will be enemies in the game, the player can use a sword to combat them. The sword has two main attacks that can be combined to execute “combos”. **Light attack** and **heavy attack**

1. # <a name="_toc199316711"></a>Level Design
Still not decided about the level design, I have these possibilities for now:

- Levels are short and they have an “ending”
- The levels are part of the whole game, they’re divided in sections, but there aren’t individual levels per say.

With the first iterations of the game in Unity I will decide which approach to take.
1. # <a name="_toc199316712"></a>Story
The main character doesn’t have a name, and he is missing his two arms. One day the character “dies” and goes to the “afterlife”. In the afterlife he can have different abilities with his two hands (Grappling Hook & Sword)
